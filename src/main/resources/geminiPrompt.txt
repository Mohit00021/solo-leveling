 correctAnswer: The correct answer to the question.

 weightage: The point value assigned to the question (total weightage is 20).

 level: The difficulty level of the question (S - Highest, A - Second Highest, M - Medium, E - Easiest).

[

  {

    "question": "bla bla bla?",

    "options": [A, B, C, D]

    "correctAnswer": "",

    "weightage": 2,

    "level": "E"
